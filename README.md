# cpp-iterators

For quite some time now, there's a language out there that is loved by a lot of programmers (including myself)
and that language is called Rust. \
However, I like C++ too so I decided to borrow (pun intended) the iterators idea/design from Rust and bring it to C++. \
This project aims to "redefine" the way iterators work in C++ and make it more like Rust and more functional like in general. \
There are already quite some iterators implemented so far but I need to add more tests when I have the time. Also, they seem to
produce quite good assembly quality with optimizations on. \
This is work in progress and aims to provide a better API from the awful ```begin``` and ```end``` iterators that C++ has.
